    abstract = {his paper presents a novel system for autonomous,vision-based  drone  racing  combining  learned  data  abstraction,nonlinear  filtering,  and  time-optimal  trajectory  planning.  Thesystem  has  successfully  been  deployed  at  the  first  autonomousdrone racing world championship: the2019 AlphaPilot Challenge.Contrary to traditional drone racing systems, which only detectthe  next  gate,  our  approach  makes  use  of  any  visible  gate  andtakes  advantage  of  multiple,  simultaneous  gate  detections  tocompensate for drift in the state estimate and build a global mapof the gates. The global map and drift-compensated state estimateallow  the  drone  to  navigate  through  the  race  course  even  whenthe gates are not immediately visible and further enable to plana  near  time-optimal  path  through  the  race  course  in  real  timebased on approximate drone dynamics. The proposed system hasbeen demonstrated to successfully guide the drone through tightrace courses reaching speeds up to8 m/sand ranked second atthe2019 AlphaPilot Challenge.},

    abstract = {Adding more cameras to SLAM systems improvesrobustness and accuracy but complicates the design of the visualfront-end significantly. Thus, most systems in the literature aretailored  for  specific  camera  configurations.  In  this  work,  we aim  at  an  adaptive  SLAM  system  that  works  for  arbitrarymulti-camera  setups.  To  this  end,  we  revisit  several  commonbuilding  blocks  in  visual  SLAM.  In  particular,  we  propose  anadaptive  initialization  scheme,  a  sensor-agnostic,  information-theoretic  keyframe  selection  algorithm,  and  a  scalable  voxel-based  map.  These  techniques  make  little  assumption  aboutthe  actual  camera  setups  and  prefer  theoretically  groundedmethods  over  heuristics.  We  adapt  a  state-of-the-art  visual-inertial  odometry  with  these  modifications,  and  experimentalresults  show  that  the  modified  pipeline  can  adapt  to  a  widerange of camera setups (e.g., 2 to 6 cameras in one experiment)without  the  need  of  sensor-specific  modifications  or  tuning},

    abstract = {In  modern  visual  SLAM  systems,  it  is  a  stan-dard  practice  to  retrieve  potential  candidate  map  points  fromoverlapping  keyframes  for  further  feature  matching  or  directtracking.  In  this  work,  we  argue  that  keyframes  are  not  theoptimal choice for this task, due to several inherent limitations,such  as  weak  geometric  reasoning  and  poor  scalability.  Wepropose  a  voxel-map  representation  to  efficiently  retrieve  mappoints  for  visual  SLAM.  In  particular,  we  organize  the  mappoints in a regular voxel grid. Visible points from a camera poseare  queried  by  sampling  the  camera  frustum  in  a  raycastingmanner, which can be done in constant time using an efficientvoxel hashing method. Compared with keyframes, the retrievedpoints   using   our   method   are   geometrically   guaranteed   tofall  in  the  camera  field-of-view,  and  occluded  points  can  beidentified  and  removed  to  a  certain  extend.  This  method  alsonaturally  scales  up  to  large  scenes  and  complicated  multi-camera   configurations.  Experimental   results   show  that   ourvoxel  map  representation  is  as  efficient  as  a  keyframe  mapwith5keyframes and provides significantly higher localizationaccuracy (average 46% improvement in RMSE) on the EuRoCdataset.  The  proposed  voxel-map  representation  is  a  generalapproach  to  a  fundamental  functionality  in  visual  SLAM  andwidely  applicable.},

 abstract={This paper presents two new designs to implement a ternary half adder using Carbon Nanotubes Field Effect Transistors (CNFETs). Ternary logic is a promising alternative to conventional binary logic, since it is possible to accomplish simplicity and energy efficiency in modern digital design due to reduced circuit overhead such as interconnect and chip area. In this paper the authors are presenting two different novel ternary half adder circuits using ternary decoders and binary logic gates. The circuits are simulated using HSPICE to obtain power, delay and power delay product. The circuit performances are compared with the recently reported designs. The proposed ternary adders show delay and power advantage up to 40 and 39% with less transistor count. So, use of these half adders in complex arithmetic circuits will be advantageous.},

This paper presents a pair of circuits for implementing a ternary half adder using carbon nanotube field-effect transistors. The proposed designs combine both futuristic ternary and conventional binary logic design approach. One of the proposed circuits for ternary to binary decoder simplifies further circuit implementation and provides excellent delay and power advantages in data path circuit such as adder. These circuits have been extensively simulated using HSPICE to obtain power, delay, and power delay product. The circuit performances are compared with alternative designs reported in recent literature. One of the proposed ternary adders has been demonstrated power, power delay product improvement up to 63% and 66% respectively, with lesser transistor count.
